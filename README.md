# C-SOF
This repository contains description and code files of a project aiming to ascertain the association between caregiver status and mortality using survival data from the Caregiver Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (CG-SOF).
In this project, I reported the distribution of deaths and person-years by various dichotomous caregiving exposures 
(including fixed/baseline, time-varying, and lagged) and reported the crude and adjusted hazard ratios and 
95% confidence intervals. All models used age-based risk sets with the time-varying version of the age categories. The adjusted models controlled for race, education, marital status, weight, stress and depression.
